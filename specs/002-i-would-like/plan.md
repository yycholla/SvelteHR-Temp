# Implementation Plan: GelDB Login Page Integration (Updated)

**Branch**: `002-i-would-like` | **Date**: 2025-01-13 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/home/yycholla/Documents/SvelteHR/specs/002-i-would-like/spec.md`

**UPDATED CONTEXT**: GelDB is already running in MountainHR-backend with existing RBAC system. Schema changes should be made directly to .gel files, no migrations needed at this time.

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)

```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
4. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
5. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, or `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI).
6. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
7. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
8. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:

- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary

Integrate SvelteKit frontend with existing MountainHR-Backend GelDB authentication system. Replace custom login with GelDB's built-in UI using Magic Link authentication. Leverage existing RBAC::User system with schema enhancements for GelDB identity linking. Focus on frontend-backend integration rather than database setup since GelDB auth extension is already configured and running.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.0 with SvelteKit 2.22.0 (frontend) + Go with GelDB (existing backend)  
**Primary Dependencies**: SvelteKit, existing MountainHR-Backend API, GelDB Auth Extension (already enabled)  
**Storage**: GelDB (already running) with existing RBAC::User entities, schema enhancements needed  
**Testing**: Vitest 3.2.3 (unit), Playwright 1.49.1 (E2E), integration tests against live MountainHR-Backend  
**Target Platform**: Web browsers (desktop/mobile responsive), existing Docker containerized backend
**Project Type**: web (SvelteKit frontend integration with existing GelDB backend)  
**Performance Goals**: <200ms auth redirect, <500ms token validation, leverage existing backend performance  
**Constraints**: No new database migrations, use existing MountainHR-Backend API patterns, maintain RBAC compatibility  
**Scale/Scope**: HR application integration with existing user base and roles (Admin, HR_Manager, Manager, Employee)

**Backend Integration**: MountainHR-Backend running at `/home/yycholla/Documents/MountainHR-Backend/` with GelDB auth already configured. Schema changes via direct .gel file updates, not migrations.

## Constitution Check

_GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design._

**Simplicity**:

- Projects: 2 (SvelteKit frontend integration + existing MountainHR-Backend)
- Using framework directly? Yes (SvelteKit direct, existing GelDB API direct)
- Single data model? Yes (existing RBAC::User entity with minor enhancements)
- Avoiding patterns? Yes (use existing backend patterns, no new wrappers)

**Architecture**:

- EVERY feature as library? YES - frontend auth services as reusable libraries
- Libraries listed: 
  - `frontend-auth-service` (SvelteKit integration, token management)
  - `geldb-integration-service` (backend communication, session handling)
- CLI per library: Integrate with existing MountainHR-Backend CLI patterns
- Library docs: Follow existing MountainHR-Backend documentation patterns

**Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**:

- RED-GREEN-Refactor cycle enforced? YES (tests fail first, then implement)
- Git commits show tests before implementation? YES (contract tests commit first)
- Order: Contract→Integration→E2E→Unit strictly followed? YES
- Real dependencies used? YES (actual MountainHR-Backend instance, not mocks)
- Integration tests for: frontend-backend auth flow, RBAC integration, existing API compatibility
- FORBIDDEN: Implementation before test, skipping RED phase

**Observability**:

- Structured logging included? YES (integrate with existing backend logging)
- Frontend logs → backend? YES (leverage existing MountainHR logging infrastructure)
- Error context sufficient? YES (auth failures, integration errors, user context)

**Versioning**:

- Version number assigned? 1.0.0 (frontend auth integration)
- BUILD increments on every change? YES
- Breaking changes handled? YES (parallel auth during migration, maintain existing API compatibility)

**Structure Decision**: Frontend-Backend Integration (SvelteKit frontend integrating with existing MountainHR-Backend)

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:

   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

_Prerequisites: research.md complete_

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `/scripts/update-agent-context.sh [claude|gemini|copilot]` for your AI assistant
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/\*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach

_This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan_

**Task Generation Strategy**:

- Load `/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P]
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:

- TDD order: Tests before implementation
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation

_These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command_

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking

_Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified_

| Violation                  | Why Needed         | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
| -------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| [e.g., 4th project]        | [current need]     | [why 3 projects insufficient]        |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient]  |
