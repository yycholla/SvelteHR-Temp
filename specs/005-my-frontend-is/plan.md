# Implementation Plan: Fix Authentication Redirect Loop

**Branch**: `005-my-frontend-is` | **Date**: 2025-01-18 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/005-my-frontend-is/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
4. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
5. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, or `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI).
6. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
7. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
8. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
**Primary Requirement**: Fix authentication redirect loop that prevents users from accessing the application after successful login. Users are experiencing infinite redirects between login and dashboard pages despite having valid credentials and authentication tokens.

**Technical Approach**: Conduct thorough investigation of SvelteKit authentication patterns, PostGraphile integration, and client-side state management. Use Playwright for automated testing to reproduce and validate fixes. Apply incremental changes to isolate root causes while maintaining security.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x, SvelteKit 2.x, Node.js 18+
**Primary Dependencies**: SvelteKit, PostGraphile, Urql GraphQL client, JWT authentication, Playwright testing
**Storage**: PostgreSQL via PostGraphile GraphQL API
**Testing**: Playwright (E2E), Vitest (unit), @testing-library/svelte (component)
**Target Platform**: Web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari), responsive design
**Project Type**: web - frontend SvelteKit + backend PostGraphile
**Performance Goals**: <200ms authentication validation, no redirect loops, stable session state
**Constraints**: Must maintain existing security model, no breaking changes to auth tokens, preserve JWT-based authentication
**Scale/Scope**: Multi-role system (admin, HR, manager, employee), session management across tabs, network resilience

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Simplicity**:
- Projects: 2 (frontend SvelteKit + backend PostGraphile) - within limit
- Using framework directly? YES (SvelteKit auth hooks, no wrapper classes)
- Single data model? YES (unified auth state, JWT tokens)
- Avoiding patterns? YES (direct Svelte stores, no Repository pattern needed)

**Architecture**:
- EVERY feature as library? This is a bug fix, not new feature - modifying existing auth libraries
- Libraries affected: auth store, auth service, navigation guards
- CLI per library: N/A (frontend debugging via browser tools)
- Library docs: Will update existing component documentation

**Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**:
- RED-GREEN-Refactor cycle enforced? YES - Playwright tests must fail first to reproduce bug
- Git commits show tests before implementation? YES - test reproduction before fixes
- Order: Contract→Integration→E2E→Unit strictly followed? YES - E2E reproduction first
- Real dependencies used? YES (actual PostgreSQL, PostGraphile, browser)
- Integration tests for: auth flow changes, token validation, redirect logic
- FORBIDDEN: Implementation before test, skipping RED phase - WILL ENFORCE

**Observability**:
- Structured logging included? YES (console.log with structured format for auth debugging)
- Frontend logs → backend? NO (client-side auth issue, frontend logs sufficient)
- Error context sufficient? YES (auth state, token validity, redirect attempts)

**Versioning**:
- Version number assigned? 0.0.1 (bug fix increment)
- BUILD increments on every change? YES
- Breaking changes handled? NO breaking changes expected (internal auth fix)

**Structure Decision**: Option 2 (Web application) - SvelteKit frontend with PostGraphile backend

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `/scripts/update-agent-context.sh [claude|gemini|copilot]` for your AI assistant
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P] 
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation 
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |


## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
