# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
4. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
5. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, or `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI).
6. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
7. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
8. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Migration from Carbon Design System to shadcn-svelte for modern, sleek UI with focus on data presentation. Replace quick navigation cards with efficient sidebar/topbar layout prioritizing data visibility and clean aesthetics. Maintain all HR functionality while upgrading visual presentation using shadcn component patterns.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x with SvelteKit 2.x, Node.js 20+
**Primary Dependencies**: shadcn-svelte, Lucide icons, TailwindCSS, Svelte 5 runes
**Storage**: PostgreSQL 15+ with PostGraphile GraphQL (existing system)
**Testing**: Vitest, Playwright, @testing-library/svelte (existing test stack)
**Target Platform**: Modern web browsers (Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+)
**Project Type**: web - SvelteKit frontend + PostgreSQL backend
**Performance Goals**: <200ms page loads, 60fps animations, <2MB bundle size
**Constraints**: Maintain accessibility standards, preserve all HR functionality, responsive design
**Scale/Scope**: 127 employees, 8 departments, admin/HR/manager/employee roles

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Simplicity**:
- Projects: 1 (frontend UI migration only)
- Using framework directly? YES (shadcn-svelte components used directly)
- Single data model? YES (existing PostgreSQL schema preserved)
- Avoiding patterns? YES (no unnecessary abstractions for UI components)

**Architecture**:
- EVERY feature as library? N/A (UI migration, not new feature libraries)
- Libraries listed: shadcn-svelte (UI components), Lucide (icons), TailwindCSS (styling)
- CLI per library: N/A (UI components, not CLI tools)
- Library docs: YES (shadcn component documentation focus as requested)

**Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**:
- RED-GREEN-Refactor cycle enforced? YES (visual regression tests first)
- Git commits show tests before implementation? YES (accessibility + visual tests)
- Order: Contract→Integration→E2E→Unit strictly followed? YES (component contracts → page integration → E2E flows)
- Real dependencies used? YES (actual PostGraphile backend preserved)
- Integration tests for: UI component integration, layout responsiveness, accessibility
- FORBIDDEN: Implementation before test, skipping RED phase

**Observability**:
- Structured logging included? YES (preserve existing frontend error logging)
- Frontend logs → backend? YES (existing PostGraphile integration maintained)
- Error context sufficient? YES (component-level error boundaries)

**Versioning**:
- Version number assigned? 1.0.0 (major UI overhaul)
- BUILD increments on every change? YES
- Breaking changes handled? YES (parallel component testing, gradual migration)

**Structure Decision**: Option 2 (Web application) - SvelteKit frontend with PostgreSQL backend via PostGraphile

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `/scripts/update-agent-context.sh [claude|gemini|copilot]` for your AI assistant
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 artifacts (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Component migration tasks based on contract specifications
- Testing tasks for visual regression and accessibility
- Documentation tasks for shadcn component usage patterns
- Performance optimization tasks for bundle size and loading

**Ordering Strategy**:
- Foundation first: Setup shadcn-svelte, TailwindCSS, theming
- Layout components: Sidebar, Header, main layout structure
- Data display: Cards, tables, metrics, progress indicators
- Forms and interactions: Input components, validation, modals
- Polish and optimization: Dark mode, accessibility, performance

**Task Categories**:
1. **Setup Tasks** [P] - Independent installation and configuration
2. **Layout Tasks** - Sequential component replacement (sidebar → header → layout)
3. **Component Tasks** [P] - Parallel migration of data display components
4. **Integration Tasks** - Sequential integration with existing backend
5. **Testing Tasks** [P] - Parallel visual regression and accessibility tests
6. **Documentation Tasks** [P] - Component usage guides and examples
7. **Performance Tasks** - Bundle optimization and caching strategies

**Estimated Output**: 35-40 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md with clear dependencies

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |


## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
